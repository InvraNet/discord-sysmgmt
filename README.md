## Development target
I will work on this discord bot sometimes. RIght now I will be looking into getting macOS really great support, as Apple likes to be very nice with their developers on which intents are a pain to setup.
The Linux version will be the least-neglected as all up, I use Linux as a daily driver, and also it is seemingly easiest to do the tasks which I am doing, Linux is at the top of the hierachy, thenits windows, then macOS.
There is chance of me going to make a audio encoding for a video stream, where you can join a voic call with the bot, it will stream the video via audio, and an app I *may create* will translate it into a audio stream
This is a great way to dip my toes a little more into computer management, or my project ScreenSHX, which this will be a major step in the way for ScreenSHX for a little more experience with computer management on my side.
